## Instacart Basket Analysis - Python Project 

### Objective
Analysing sales patterns, performing exploratory analysis, and deriving insights for a better segmentation for an online grocery store, Instacart. The company is interested in understanding the purchase behavior from their customers, so they could deliver better targeted marketing campaigns. My role as Data Analyst is to give a recommendation.

### Purpose and Context:
During one of my courses at CareerFoundry, I had a project that introduced me to the world of Python. This project was key because it allowed me to apply my analitical skills for performing exploratory analysis in a very big dataset.

### Goal
Deliver a final report including tables and visualizations that profile Instacart customers based on their purchase behaviors.
